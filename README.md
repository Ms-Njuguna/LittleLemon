Little Lemon is a modern, responsive restaurant web application that allows customers to explore the restaurant, reserve tables, and initiate online orders through a clean, intuitive interface.

Built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**, the project demonstrates real-world front-end architecture including client-side routing, component-driven design, responsive layouts, and production-ready build optimization.

End-to-end testing with Cypress ensures reliability of key user interactions and helps deliver a fast, accessible, and visually consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.
